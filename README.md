# LangGraph-with-Single-and-Multi-nodes-
This code showcases the LangGraph framework, which enables the development of conversational AI models that can answer general questions and retrieve information from external sources. The framework is built on top of the LangChain library and utilizes Google's Gemma2-9b Large Language Model (LLM)

Single-Node Chatbot

The single-node chatbot is designed to answer general questions and provide responses to user queries. It leverages the power of the Gemma2-9b LLM to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions

Multi-Node Chatbot

The multi-node chatbot takes conversational AI to the next level by connecting to external knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia and arXiv. This allows the chatbot to provide more accurate and informative responses to user queries
